With this mod, never miss out when you drop a loot with low chance! Includes all sorts of loot such as NPC Drops and Loot Bags! (Boss Bags, Crates, Presents & More!)

This mod is fully compatible with ALL MODS and Multiplayer!

What this mod brings as whenever you drop something below given chance (5% by default):
> You will get a colored Text, which shows how much chance it was, item's name and hoverable item in your chat! 
> An exciting Sound Effect to alert you that you've dropped a rare drop! (defaults to Hypixel Skyblock's rare drop sound effect)
> Lots of config options to customize your Rare Drop Notification to your liking! Even with an option of using a custom sound effect, you can use any sound effect you want within your loaded mods!
